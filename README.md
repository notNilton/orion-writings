# RADARE - A graduate thesis on web-development of a web-based data reconciliation dashboard

## Overview

This repository contains the LaTeX source files for my graduate thesis titled **"Web Data Reconciliation Dashboard: A Modern Approach to Industrial Data Analysis"**. The thesis is written in Brazilian Portuguese (PT-BR) and focuses on developing a web-based application for reconciling industrial process data using contemporary methods and technologies.

## Abstract

In the context of Industry 4.0, the accurate reconciliation of process data is crucial for ensuring the reliability and efficiency of industrial operations. This thesis presents the development of a web-based dashboard that facilitates data reconciliation in industrial settings. The application integrates modern data analysis techniques and visualization tools, enabling engineers and operators to make informed decisions based on reconciled data. The thesis explores the design, implementation, and evaluation of the dashboard, providing insights into its potential impact on industrial data management.

## Key Areas of Research

- **Data Reconciliation**: Techniques and methods for improving data accuracy in industrial processes.
- **Web Application Development**: Leveraging modern web technologies to create a user-friendly dashboard interface.
- **Industrial Process Optimization**: Applying reconciled data for enhancing operational efficiency.
